# üìä Advertising Campaign Performance Analysis: Facebook vs. AdWords

## Project Overview
This project involves conducting A/B testing to evaluate the performance of two marketing campaigns: Facebook Ads and Google Adwords for an online retail business. The primary goal is to determine which campaign is more effective in driving user engagement and conversions, helping the company optimize its marketing strategies.

A/B testing is a methodology used to experiment and compare two versions of a marketing approach to identify the better performing option based on metrics such as conversion rate, click-through rate, and overall revenue.

## üß© Problem Statement
As a marketing agency, our objective is to maximize the return on investment (ROI) for advertising campaigns. This project analyzes two major platforms **Facebook Ads** and **AdWords** to determine which one delivers better results in terms of **clicks**, **conversions**, and **cost-effectiveness**.

**3. Hypothesis Testing**:
- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: Facebook Ads and Google Adwords perform equally.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: One campaign performs better than the other.
- Perform statistical tests (e.g., t-tests) to assess the significance of any performance differences between the campaigns.

**4. Conclusion**: Identify which campaign is more effective based on statistical evidence.
